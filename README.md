# ModularTreeModeler

![Teaser](https://github.com/RyuZhihao123/Modular-Tree-Modeler-25/blob/main/Figures/1.png)

Procedural modeling (e.g., L-systems) is a classic method for synthesizing 3D plant models in computer graphics. However, existing procedural methods always rely on algorithmically writing complex structural rules, thus very difficult and unintuitive for non-experts to learn.

This repository contains a more advanced 3D modeling system, which enables users to **intuitively** manipulate a so-called **``Modular Graph``** to easily design and obtain diverse 3D plant models.

ðŸŸ  [[Program Download]](https://github.com/RyuZhihao123/Modular-Tree-Modeler-25/tree/main/GraphTreeModeler): Please download the entire folder to execute the program.

## Quick Start

ðŸŸ¡ [[Full Instruction Video]](): We strongly recommend that all users carefully watch this long instruction video to understand the step-by-step process of designing a tree species.



### Usage Instructions:

(1) Open the ``GraphTreeModeler.exe``. This is the window for visualization of 3D results. 

(2) Then open the ``GraphTreeModeler_UI.exe``, which is the user interface for the interactive design of species graphs. Please note that, the two exes must be opened in this order.

(2) Design Graphs. Now you can freely use the following operations (hot keys)
 to gradually customize your own graphs!

- ``LeftMouseButtion``: Select an existing node.
- ``Ctrl`` + ``LeftMouseButtion``: Add a new node.
- ``Alt`` + ``LeftMouseButtion``: Connect edges between two nodes.
- ``Backspace``: Delete the selected node.
