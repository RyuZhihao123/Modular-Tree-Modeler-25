# ModularTreeModeler

![Teaser](https://github.com/RyuZhihao123/Modular-Tree-Modeler-25/blob/main/Figures/1.png)

Procedural modeling (e.g., L-systems) is a classic method for synthesizing 3D plant models in computer graphics. However, existing procedural methods always rely on algorithmically writing complex structural rules, thus very difficult and unintuitive for non-experts to learn.

This repository contains a more advanced 3D modeling system, which enables users to **intuitively** manipulate a so-called **``Modular Graph``** to easily design and obtain diverse 3D plant models. 

ðŸ“º **[[Preview Video]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FugtnOsYm2L_HkJawwiUUKoe6aQs5e93/view?usp=sharing): This is a short demo video for fast preview.** ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥

ðŸŸ  [[Program Download]](https://github.com/RyuZhihao123/Modular-Tree-Modeler-25/tree/main/GraphTreeModeler): Please download the entire folder to execute the program.

## Quick Start

ðŸŸ¡ Before starting, we strongly recommend that all users carefully watch this [[5-min Instruction Video]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uOwghzsHS2jrZXc8RHVIOitZZubseMT-/view?usp=sharing) to understand the step-by-step process of designing a simple tree species.



### Usage Instructions:
This software is only runable in Windows (we successfully tested on Win 10 and Win 11).

(0) Download the program from [this folder](https://github.com/RyuZhihao123/Modular-Tree-Modeler-25/tree/main/GraphTreeModeler).

(1) Open the ``GraphTreeModeler.exe``. This is the window for visualization of 3D results. 

(2) Then open the ``GraphTreeModeler_UI.exe``, which is the user interface for the interactive design of species graphs. 

- The second exe will take around 6 seconds for initialization. Please be patient to wait.
- **You must make sure to sequentially open two exes in this order.** They have dependencies thus cannot be opened in an inverse order.

(2) Design Graphs. Now you can freely use the following operations (hot keys)
 to gradually customize your own graphs! Watch the 5-min instruction video to see how to operate them.

- ``Left MouseButtion``: Select/move an existing node.
- ``Ctrl`` + ``Left MouseButtion``: Add a new node.
- ``Alt`` + ``Left MouseButtion``: Connect edges between two nodes.
- ``Backspace``: Delete a selected node.
